***Objective 3: Algorithm***\
**Task 1**\
Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).\
If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.\

**Solution:**\
1: Ask the user to enter the number n.\
2: Ask the user to enter Nth divisor.\
3: If n/N leaves remainder = 0 means it is the divisor of the desired number else it is not the divisor.\
4: Now if n/2 leaves remainder = 0 means it is an even no else odd number.\

**Task 3**\
Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)\
**Solution:**\
1: Input the numbers from user.\
2: Input Operators from user in between the numbers.\
3: Set + as add, - as subtract, * as multiply, / as divide, % as remainder.\
4: If user uses + operator then add the numbers.\
5: If user uses - operator then subtract the numbers.\
6: If user uses * operator then multiply the numbers.\
7: If user uses / operator then divide the numbers.\
8: if user uses % operator give remainder.\
5: Print the answer for the user on the screen by using DMAS rule.\

***Objective 2: PSEUDOCODE***\
**Task 03**\
Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘-‘Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with
one being used for the operator)\

START\
//Input/Output\

Input number 1\
Input Operator\
Input number 2\

//Processing\

If ‘+’ is used as an operator then\
Add number 1 and number 2\
Else if ‘–‘ is used as an operator then \
Subtract number 2 from number 1\

//Output

Print answer\
