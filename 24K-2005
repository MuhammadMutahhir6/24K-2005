***Objective 3: Algorithm***\
**Task 1**\
Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

Solution:
1: Ask the user to enter the number n.
2: Ask the user to enter Nth divisor.
3: If n/N leaves remainder = 0 means it is the divisor of the desired number else it is not the divisor.
4: Now if n/2 leaves remainder = 0 means it is an even no else odd number.
